Based on the book "Programming Languages: An Interpreter-Based Approach" by Samuel N. Kamin

This dir is my attempt at implementing the toy language from Chapter 1 of the book.

To run the interpreter as a repl, run

```cabal run ch1```

Enter

```quit```

to quit the repl.


To run the interpreter on an an input string, run

```cabal run ch1 -- <your_expression_here>```
